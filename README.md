# Assistant
 
This is my approach on coding a personal assistant. You are welcome to fork the code and apply your own modules.

Currently you will need to execute the entire programm on windows, linux is not supported at the moment.

Python3.10.8 is being used for the project.

Before you start, I would suggest that you set up virtual environment.

```python -m venv env```

Then you need to activate the env.

```. env/Scripts/activate```

Install the Dependencies from the requirements file.

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Happy Coding!
